# It will be replaced with actual workflow templates when Week 4 is implemented.
#
# Expected workflows:
# - ci.yml (multi-platform testing)
# - test-suite.yml (test execution)
# - coverage.yml (coverage reporting)
# - claude-code-review.yml (optional automated reviews)
#
# To enable workflows when implemented:
#   ./klaus-baudelaire/setup-github-actions.sh enable
