**FULL TIER INTELLIGENCE PIPELINE**

Execute the user's request using the complete Klaus intelligence system with all agents, research capabilities, and planning coordination.

**User Request:**
${ARGS}

---

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### PHASE 1-FULL: Full Intelligence
═══════════════════════════════

Launch in parallel:
- @"explore-lead (agent)" - Comprehensive codebase analysis
- @"research-lead (agent)" - Multi-source research with Context7 suite
- @"web-research-specialist (agent)" - Documentation and best practices
- @"docs-specialist (agent)" - Library/API documentation lookup (Context7)
- @"file-path-extractor (agent)" - Track file paths from bash output

Then @"plan-orchestrator (agent)" → Create implementation plan

---

### IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
═══════════════════════════════

[1] IMPLEMENTATION: Edit/Write → Follow plan systematically
[2] VERIFICATION: Run tests → Fix issues (max 3 attempts)
[3] DELIVERY: Summarize changes and results

---

### SPECIALIZED AGENTS (Use as needed):
═══════════════════════════════

- @"docs-specialist" - Fast library/API documentation (Context7 tools, haiku model)
- @"web-research-specialist" - Documentation and best practices research (Context7 tools)
- @"code-simplifier" - Refactor code for clarity (Context7 for library best practices)
- @"test-infrastructure-agent" - Setup test infrastructure (Context7 for test frameworks)
- @"explore-light" - Quick codebase exploration (Context7 library identification)
- @"reminder-nudger-agent" - Progress monitoring and strategic guidance
- @"file-path-extractor" - Extract file paths from bash command output

---

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

[!!!] This is a FULL tier execution - use maximum intelligence and thoroughness
[!!!] Launch agents in parallel when possible for optimal performance
[!!!] Create comprehensive implementation plan before coding
[!!!] Context7 tools available for library/API documentation lookup
[!!!] Maximum 3 test fix attempts before reporting issues
[!!!] Execute autonomously - no user approval needed unless ambiguous

---

## EXECUTION PRIORITY

1. **Research Phase**: Gather all necessary context, documentation, and best practices
2. **Planning Phase**: Design comprehensive implementation strategy
3. **Implementation Phase**: Execute plan with precision
4. **Verification Phase**: Test thoroughly and fix issues
5. **Delivery Phase**: Report results with clear summary

---

**BEGIN EXECUTION NOW**

Process the user's request using the FULL tier pipeline. Launch all Phase 1 agents in parallel, create a plan, implement systematically, verify with tests, and deliver results.
