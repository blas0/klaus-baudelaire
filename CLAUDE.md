# CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

IF this file exists in the `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/` & you are directed or inclined to `write` `edit` `bash` to any of the files in the `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` interacting with these files by FOLLOWING THESE INSTRUCTIONS EXPLICITLY:

1. ONLY `write` `edit` `bash` to the files in this `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` NOT ANYWHERE ELSE.

BECAUSE:
THE FILES IN `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`  MIRROR SOME FILES WITHIN THE `~/.claude` DIR.

2. WRITE UNIT TESTS TO VALIDATE PROOF OF CONCEPTS

3. AFTER `bash`, `write` & or `edit` TO FILES:

- WRITE INTEGRATION TESTS FOR MIGRATING FILE CHANGES APPROPRIATELY:

`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` -> `~/.claude` 

4. IF UNIT + INTEGRATIONS PASS/FAIL -> `AskUserQuestion` FOR NEXT STEPS

- WHEN TESTS PASS MIGRATE FROM `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` TO `~/.claude`?
- SUGGEST OTHER ACTIONS FOR RESOLVING FAILED TESTS:

# CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (CONT.):
